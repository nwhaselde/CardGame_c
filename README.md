"# ProgrammingAssignment_java"
This was for my data structures class and it creates Huffman codes that can encrypt a word or decipher a word if given the correct weights of each character. 
Grade given: A

"# Primes_c"
Written in c, this program takes in an integer value, n, and will then compute an list of length n of prime numbers in order. I used Euclid's proof of infinite primes' logic in order to come up with this algorithm. "If a number doesn't divide into any other prime number, that number is itself, a prime number."

"# Recursion_java"
A pretty simple recursive algorithm that I wrote for my freshman level intro to programming class.
Grade give: I don't remember.

"# CSCI440 Project 3&4_js"
Project 3 - We were told to have 2 dogs each of which has their own Jump, WalkForward, WalkBackward, and Wag buttons. There was to also be a single Reset button that reset everything about the dog except for their positions on the x-axis. 
Grade given: A
Project 4 - This was the final project of the class and we were given almost complete creative liberty. The only requirement was to have atleast more than 1 character being projected and a minimum of 4 buttons that all did something unique a long with a reset button. I decided to make 3 characters, 2 guitar players and a dog, "play" different genres of music depending on which button you click. If you click "Funky" they dance funky-ly, if you click "Metal" they headbang, etc. Note: click reset before clicking a new button.
Grade given: Do not know at the time of updating this README file
